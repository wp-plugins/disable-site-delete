Disable Site Delete plugin completely disables the site/blog deletion by a non network administrator

== Description ==

Disable Site Delete plugin only allows network administrators to delete a blog/site on a WordPress Multisite network. It does not allow blog owners to delete their blogs.

It works by doing that in 3 steps:-

*   Removes the delete Site link from tools menu for non network admins
*   Breaks out of wpmu_delete_blog function to avoid deletion of blog
*   hacks around option to avoid sending the delete confirmation mail to blog owner

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does it completely removes the capability to delete blog for blog admins/owners =

That's right. Only network administrator can delete a blog.

= How to localize =
Please look into the 'languages' directory of this plugin. you will find the po file. Just translate it and save there as your_locale.mo(e.f en_US.mo)

= Is there an alternative? =
Yes, there is a plugin by Ryan Hellyer [Delete Delete Site](http://wordpress.org/plugins/delete-delete-site/ "Delete Delete Site") but that only removes the menu link and does not actually prevent users from doing it completely(try typing the url and you will know what I mean).
